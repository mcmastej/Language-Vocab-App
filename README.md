# V8.0 Korean Memory Game — Vocab + Grammar

V8.0 preserves the verified V7.2 Vocab games and introduces a separate Grammar branch.

## App hierarchy
- Vocab
  - Speaking/Writing
  - Listening/Reading
- Grammar
  - Answering a Question

## Grammar prototype
The first Grammar deck uses two existing images:
- `000.jpg`: "What fruit is this?" / `이 과일은 뭐예요?`
  - Exact answer: `이 과일은 사과예요`
- `001.jpg`: "Is this a dog or a cat?" / `이게 개예요, 아니면 고양이예요?`
  - Exact answer: `이게 고양이예요`

`이게` is used consistently in both the second question and its answer.

### Grammar flow
- Cards are shuffled at the beginning.
- The Korean question is spoken automatically when a card appears.
- A speaker button replays the question.
- Answers can be typed or entered with browser speech recognition.
- Answer checking is exact apart from leading/trailing/repeated whitespace normalization.
- Correct cards are completed and removed.
- Incorrect cards reveal the correct answer and are appended to the back of the stack.
- The deck ends only after every card has been answered correctly.
- Progress is shown as Completed X / 2.

## Development notes
- All 30 Vocab images remain root-level.
- Grammar reuses existing images rather than duplicating them.
- Grammar content is stored separately in `grammar.js` for future expansion.
- Service worker remains disabled during development/testing.
